Hi,

We need to remove this code from our source tree due to possible IP issues:

src/test/resources/poi_large.xml

Can someone prepare a reasonably large test case XML in replacement of this?

This roadmap is for explaining the how we focus on what we deliver. I
have not attached any timeline with this.

Priority-wise arranged:

* Make application functional on all features promised. First in POI,
later incorporate it to JXL implementation. The feature request &
bugs:
https://developer.berlios.de/feature/?group_id=6203
https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=6203

* Announce to JXL and POI community existence of this project--I will
be doing this shortly.

* Market this application:
  -> Have the URL as mail signature
  -> Post in ur blogs
  -> Digg (after we have a good alpha release)

Currently the implementation engine--be it be POI or JXL--usage of it
is defined during the runtime using the system parameter
"xml2xls.impl=jxl" or "xml2xls.impl=poi".

This is not a model which will work well in J2EE environment. We need
to rethink this design issue too.

It is in Public Domain. Anyone can use it any way they want! This is
the original model I had thought upon, and registered the project with
this. If anyone of you have difference of opinion, please tell.

I just had a look at another very popular public domain tool:
http://www.antlr.org/

Their source code does not have any "public domain" header. Probably
we can also follow the same model.

I am wondering if I can request XML input from users without the DTD
DOCTYPE header, but internally validate the XML against the DTD
packaged in the Jar. All the googled results show otherwise. Can
anyone of you throw some light on this?

XML without DTD? I feel no. Even it would help the users to have a
first level of validation before they invoke the API. This is what I feel.

The issue is with technical difficulty. We have to maintain a version
of DTD for each version of the application in the site.

We will definitely give the users DTD for their own validation. But my
point is, we should not enforce the users to supply DOCTYPE header
specifying DTD. A flexibility like this makes it so much easier to
write a new Ant script (unlike us, build.xml I believe does not have a
DTD) or a Maven pom.xml.

This article seems to address my original question, validating XML
against an arbitrary DTD:

http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-javaxmlvalidapi.html

Good to know that u r working in similar lines. Right now we don't
want to expand our scope to bring in logic of xls->xml. The xml->xls
is the immediate usecase we are focusing to implement.

DTD validation is not possible using javax.xml.validation APIs:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/xml/validation/SchemaFactory.html

Thinking of converting our DTD to RelaxNG or XML Schema (using
http://people.apache.org/~andyc/neko/doc/dtd/index.html). I personally
favor RelaxNG because all my attempts to learn XML Schema has ended in
failure because of its complexity!

But I will miss the beautifully generated DTDDoc maven plugin :-(

Sure, that is possible:

https://developer.berlios.de/docman/display_doc.php?docid=458&group_id=2

So if u go through this, u will see that we need a separate mailing
list for this. I have created xml2spreadsheet-svn at lists.berlios.de
mailing list for this purpose--the thing is it will take about 6-24
hrs to create this mailing list. After this gets created, u can add ur
self to this mailing list.

Regards,
Subhash.

Subject: [Xml2spreadsheet-dev] The Path Towards RelaxNG
Message-ID: <91ae21990612050611v5f666c0at76abe599380fae39@mail.gmail.com>

I have converted our DTD to relaxng format.

But while executing validation test on this, I got the exception:

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No SchemaFactory that implements
the schema language specified by: http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0
could be loaded

Then in this article:

http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-javaxmlvalidapi.html

I got the explanation:

This is because, out of the box, the JDK doesn't include a RELAX NG
validator. When the schema language isn't recognized,
SchemaFactory.newInstance() throws an IllegalArgumentException.
However, if you install a RELAX NG library such as Jing and a JAXP 1.3
adapter, then it should produce the same answer the W3C schema does.

So now our POM has Jing added to it (svn rev.40). But still this did
not work. I need a JAXP adapter for this to work. I got one here:

https://isorelax-jaxp-bridge.dev.java.net/

But this adapter is not in Maven2 repo :-(

I have requested the project maintainer to host this Jar in the maven2
repo. If he does that, we are in luck. Else we have two options:

1. We create the POM for this adapter and request this to be hosted:
http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MEV

2. We drop RelaxNG and proceed with schema (no!!!!!!)

Let us see what works out!

Message-ID: <91ae21990612050619t71d66380vddbca9ba1b5e0cdf@mail.gmail.com>

In term of release:

* Alpha -> This should have all the features and styles we have in the
test XMLs working for POI. This should also include the work being
done by Bala for image embedding. Another feature I would love to have
is URL support--but we need to see if JXL supports this feature, only
then we will have this.

* Beta -> JXL implementation having all the above mentioned functionality.

* Final release -> Should test in multi-threaded environment and
profile it for any memory leak, and of course, the other bug fixes.

Subject: [Xml2spreadsheet-dev] RelaxNG Dropped, Going Forward With XSD
Message-ID: <91ae21990612051929qe216261g2f7749ebf28cb066@mail.gmail.com>

There were too many external dependencies, and technical
implementation problems. I have generated the XSD with a good tool (no
redundant stupid markups). So Bala, when u r working on embedded image
issue (https://developer.berlios.de/feature/index.php?func=detailfeature&feature_id=2919&group_id=6203),
u need to update the .xsd
(src/main/resources/org/wiztools/xml2spreadsheet/xml2spreadsheet.xsd).

I will be removing the .dtd and .rng by today evening from the code
line. Anyone interested in comparing them may do so.

We are making an effort to develop an FOSS documentation standards project here:

I have plans of suggesting our project to follow this standard. But it
is not finalized.
